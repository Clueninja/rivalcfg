How can I turn the lights off?

You can turn the lights off by setting the black color to the lights.

Example with Rival 100::

   rivalcfg --color=black

Example with Rival 300::

   rivalcfg --logo-color=black --wheel-color=black


How can I dim the brightness of the lights
------------------------------------------

Lights are configured via RGB color, so to have a lower brightness, just
set a darker color (e.g.Â ``#880000`` instead of ``#FF0000`` for a darker
red).
